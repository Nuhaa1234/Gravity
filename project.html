<h1>Gravitation</h1>
    <h2>Gravity, also called gravitation, in mechanics, the universal force of attraction acting between all matter. 
        It is by far the weakest known force in nature and thus plays no role in determining the internal properties of everyday matter.</h2>
<h3>Garvity on each planet</h3>
        <h4>Our solar system consists of 7 planets( Mercury, Mars, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Earth, Venus) and many other dwarf planets and each of these planetes containdifferent amount of weight on  them.
    Mercury 3375.9kg of gravity while Mars has roughly 6.4171 x 10^23kg of gravity.
    Saturn is one of the biggest planets in our solar system, the gravity is approximately 95.2 Earths or 5.68 x 10^26kg while Earth itself is 5.97 x 10^24kg.
    Neptune is 1.02 x 10^26kg, Uranus is 8.68 x 10^25kg and Venus is 4.87 x 10^24kg.
